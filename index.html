    <h1>My first VS project</h1>
    <p>Visual Studio is like an advanced version of Bracket.io and it is more like Level 3 in webpage coding.I think this will be very fun and we can arrange things (everything) in html.We can put JS and CSS both in HTML.No need to make extra files. </p>

<p>You can view the console by going to the live screen and clicking on inspect< console.Console is used to test before you do the main thing.So,that you do not make any mistakes in the main thing that you are doing.You can print anything on console by using this code: Console.log("The_Id_that_you_want_to_print");</p>
